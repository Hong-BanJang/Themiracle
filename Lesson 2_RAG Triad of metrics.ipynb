However, it is worth noting that with improved automatic differentiation software, it is now possible to invent and implement new neural network architectures without needing to do any calculus. Additionally, it is crucial to continuously learn and deepen your technical knowledge in AI. This can involve mastering various machine learning techniques and metrics, as well as gaining expertise in specific application areas such as natural language processing or computer vision. Developing skills in technology areas like probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems can also be beneficial for success in AI.\"</td>\n",

However, it is worth noting that with improved automatic differentiation software, it is now possible to invent and implement new neural network architectures without needing to do any calculus. Additionally, it is crucial to continuously learn and deepen your technical knowledge in AI. This can involve mastering various machine learning techniques and metrics, as well as gaining expertise in specific application areas such as natural language processing or computer vision. Developing skills in technology areas like probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems can also be beneficial for success in AI.\"   \n",
